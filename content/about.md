I've been a freelance Shopify developer for 3 years now, working with international clients both big and small. 

Graduating from Conestoga College in Canada, I've taken my programming chops and travelled around the world while working remotely.

I'm currently looking for on-going Shopify dev work for agencies looking to get into the e-commerce world.
