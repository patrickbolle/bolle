A while back I was building out a slider component on a client's Shopify store. In general, sliders/carousels are dead simple once you get the gist of it, but the challenge with this specific slider was that the client wanted two different 'sides' of the carousel, and wanted to be able to edit each. 

Basically he wanted a 'main' slider on the left side, and a 'promo' banner on the right side. Each individually editable (with independent photos and links) and of course mobile responsive.
